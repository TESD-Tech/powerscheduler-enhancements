# PowerScheduler Enhancements Plugin 🚀

Hello there! 👋 Welcome to the PowerScheduler Enhancements Plugin. This plugin is designed to supercharge your PowerScheduler reports by enabling Excel-style editing right within the report. No more navigating to other pages to correct or change the data displayed on the report. 🎉

## Enabled Reports 📊

The plugin is enabled for the following reports:

1. **Course List**: This is a great place to go when you begin your scheduling season. It lists all the courses offered at your school, along with all of the pertinent data used by the scheduling engine. 📚
2. **Have a Report in Mind?**: If you have a report in mind that you think would benefit from this plugin, please don't hesitate to open an [issue](https://github.com/TESD-Tech/powerscheduler-enhancements/issues)

## Features 🛠️

1. **Undo Functionality**: Made a mistake? No worries! Just press `Ctrl+Z` or `Command+Z` to undo the last change. 🔄
2. **Validation**: The Y/N columns only accept 'Y' or 'N' as values. If the value is not 'Y' or 'N', the cell will turn red and the value will not be saved. This ensures your data is always accurate. ✔️
3. **Error Handling**: If there's an error, a modal will pop up with the error message and options. If the problem persists, you can enter an Issue on our Github repo. 🆘
4. **Build and Load / Load Only Aware**: Some fields should not be edited if the report is in "Load Only" mode. The plugin is aware of this and will disable the fields accordingly. 🚫

## How to Use 📖

The plugin is embedded in the footer of the PowerScheduler report. First, install and enable the plugin. Then, all you need to do is navigate to the report and start editing. ✨

## Feedback 📬
